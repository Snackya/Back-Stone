Welcome to my room, adventurers.
Just look how it has no other exit than the one you came from. This dead end means, that I shall be your last foe, which makes me super important.
And did you see this crazy barrier? Man I am so stylish. I mean did you ever see a final boss with that much style before?
. . .
No I'm pretty sure you didn't. I mean, just look at me. S U P E R stylish.
I think this is the end of your journey. Nobody will ever touch me with my stylish barrier, which can't be deactivated by any means.
(I was so smart to make those pillars upholding the barrier so inconspicious. They will never know.)
Now! Let the final battle begin!
