Surprise!
I guess both of you didn't expect me to appear out of nowhere, did you?
Congratulations on your heroic victory. Both of you have my eternal gratitude.
...A reward?
Well, my familiy didn't become rich, because we gave every passing peasant a fortune for their minor deeds.
And neither of you is really my type either, so don't expect any "personal" reward. I'm more into guys with green robes.
So yeah...thanks I guess. I'll go home to my beautiful castle now. Have fun playing knights.
